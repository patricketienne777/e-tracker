# e-tracker

The assignment for this week was another commandline application that allows you to access and modify information through a database. Its centered around the concept of tracking employee data, hence the name E-Tracker. In terms of setting up functionality it took a little bit more time than the last because each department had to make use of the corresponding functions and there were a couple different options that that the user could choose from, that all had to be implemented. Working with mySQL was very much a different experince just trying to get the server to run. Many different steps had to be taken that I wasn't used to but I got the job done in the long run. Worked my researching skills a little hard to troubleshoot any issues that popped up but it was an educating experience regardless !
